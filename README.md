# Groundwater_Level_Correction_Program

## Summary
Monitoring geothermal groundwater level will provide useful information about the geothermal reservoir. A common way to measure geothermal groundwater level is by measuring the distance between the groundwater-surface and the wellhead. However, as reservoir pressure changes, subsidence might occur at a particular area, lower the wellhead level, and result in an inaccurate groundwater level measurement. This program is designed to automatically correct the groundwater level of a large number of groundwater wells by referencing the groundwater level to the sea level. Nearby benchmarksâ€™ elevations will be used as representative of the wellhead elevation in the calculation after offset adjustments.

## Python Version: Python 2.7
**Modules Required:**
- Tkinter
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn
- Bisect

## Input Data
This program takes three Excel spreadsheets as input data:
-	All_Benchmarks.xlsx
-	Historical_Groundwater_Level_Data.xlsx
-	Well_Locations_RL.xlsx

### Templates of all these input data are included in the repository inside the "input" folder.

**All_Benchmarks.xlsx contains:**
-	Benchmark labels
-	Benchmark coordinates. (Please use a consistent coordinate system for all input data, for example the coordinate system used in this program is NZMG, but it should work for other coordinate systems)
-	Benchmark levels over time

**Historical_Groundwater_Level_Data.xlsx contains:**
-	Well labels
-	The survey date of groundwater level
-	The depth (measured in meters), i.e. the historical groundwater level measured from the wellhead.

**Well_Locations_RL.xlsx contains:**
-	Well labels
-	Well Date (the date the well was drilled)
-	The Reduced Level (the elevation of the wellhead with reference to sea level)
-	The coordinates of the well

## Output Data
-	A Groundwater_Graphs folder that contains the corrected groundwater level over time for all wells
-	A Subsidence_Graphs folder that contains the corrected wellhead level over time for all wells.
-	A Future_Prediction_Linear folder that contains the predicted wellhead level for all wells. (This folder only exists if you choose to perform a future prediction)
-	An Outcome_Data folder that contains all output data in Excel spreadsheet format.



## Instructions
1.	Fill in your data in the input spreadsheets following the templates given in the **input** folder
2.	Double click Run_Program.py to launch the program
3.	When the program is launched, you should see a command window and a control panel as follows:

**Command Window:**
  ![Alt text](/screenshots/command_window.png?raw=true "Command Window")

**Control Panel:**

![Alt text](/screenshots/control_panel.png?raw=true "Control Panel")

4.	Click to run a step. Please note, if this your first time running the program, please run the steps in order. A s ummary is provided after the execution of each step.
5.	Run Step 1:
  ![Alt text](/screenshots/step1.png?raw=true "Step 1")
6.	Run Step 2:
    - In the command prompt, you will need to specify a distance. The program will seek for up to 2 benchmarks for each well within the distance you specified (in this example, I specified 200. i.e. 200 meters) Press enter to submit:
    ![Alt text](/screenshots/step2_1.png?raw=true "Step 2 - 1")
    - Step 2 is running:
    
    ![Alt text](/screenshots/step2_2.png?raw=true "Step 2 - 2")
7.	Run Step 3 (You will need to specify a future year that you want to predict for the wellhead level. If you do not wish to do any future prediction, enter a year that is prior to the current year.In this example, I wish to predict the wellhead level up to 2025): 
![Alt text](/screenshots/step3.png?raw=true "Step 3")
8.	General recommendation: If you decide to enter a different distance for Step 2, please delete all the output files produced by the previous run. Because a new set of benchmarks will result in a different number of wells that are eligible for groundwater level correction, previous valid outputs might be invalid for the current criteria.
